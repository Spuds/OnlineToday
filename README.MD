## Users Online Today 

### Introduction
- Quick and dirty, it lacks several features, but it gave me the opportunity to find bugs.
- Shows in the info center a list of users that logged in during the last 24 hours, week, or since midnight.
- Added title effect on the link with the "last seen" date/time.
- Added sorting of members by last seen or name, ascending or descending of the members.
- Added basic member groups sorting.
